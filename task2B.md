# :bar_chart: A Project on Plotting and Graphing

This project is my end-of-unit project where I talk about what I learned during this unit.

## My Chart Below
![alt text](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra2/FunctionGraphs/LQFgraph1.gif
)
Below is the table that follows the graph above:
x  y
---
0  1
1  2
2  3

From the table above, we can see that: 

* The __y-intercept__ is _1_
* The ___ is 1/1 which simplifies to 1
- y = 1x + 1

## Thank You for Reading!

I hope you were able to learn a thing or two
